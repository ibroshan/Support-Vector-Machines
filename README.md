## Support Vector Machines

Anomalies or outliers are instances in a dataset, which deviate from the majority of the data. Anomaly detection is the task of successfully identifying those records within a
given dataset.

Identifying outliers or anomalies in the data is referred to as outlier or anomaly detection. A subfield of machine learning which is focused on this problem is referred to as one-class classification. These are unsupervised learning algorithms that attempt to model “normal” examples in order to classify new examples as either normal or abnormal (e.g. outliers).

One-class classification algorithms can be used for binary classification tasks with a severely skewed class distribution. These techniques can be fit on the input examples from the majority class in the training dataset, then evaluated on a holdout test dataset.

### Description

We use one-class SVM to identify anomalies in the dataset.
